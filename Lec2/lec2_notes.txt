> Switch Case
    Switch is used for multiple conditions
    Syntax:
    switch(expression){
        case 1: //code
                break;
        case 2: //code
                break;
        defaultt: //code
    }

   -> only one case will be executed
   -> break is used to stop the execution of the case
   -> default is used to execute the code if none of the cases are executed
   -> break is not mandatory in switch case
